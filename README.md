#Calendar Event Generator

A simple application written in Java that takes in user input and generates an .ics file

##Notes
Please note that usage instructions may only apply to Unix based shells and I haven't tried on Windows cmd. For Windows users, download [git bash](http://www.git-scm.com/downloads) or perhaps update readme to be OS agnostic. 

##Getting Started
- Fork/Clone/Download Project

- cd to project directory

- Elevate access to compilation script (maybe)
```
sudo chmod 755 Compile.sh
```

- Running script will clear terminal and compile program
```
./Compile.sh
```

##Usage
###Run program
```
java Interface
```
if you want to import an existing .ics file, run the program like so:
```
java Interface TeamCalendar.ics
```

###Lost?
typing "commands" will give you a list of commands that you can use
```
Commands
```

##Requirements
- Java
