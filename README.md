#Calendar Event Generator

A simple application written in Java that takes in user input and generates an .ics file

##Notes
Please note that usage instructions may only apply to Unix based shells and I haven't tried on Windows cmd. For Windows users, download [git bash](http://www.git-scm.com/downloads) or perhaps update readme to be OS agnostic. 

##Usage
1. Fork/Clone/Download Project

2. cd to project directory

3. Elevate access to compilation script (maybe)
```
sudo chmod 755 Compile.sh
```

4. Running script will clear, compile program, and run it
```
./Compile.sh
```

##Requirements
- Java
