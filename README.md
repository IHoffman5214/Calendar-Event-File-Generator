A Java application that allows a user to manually manipulate an ics(calendar) file

##Getting Started

- Elevate access to compilation script (maybe)
```
sudo chmod 755 Compile.sh
```

- Run compilation script for a fresh copy of the program
```

```

```

##Notes
Please note that usage instructions may only apply to Unix based shells and I haven't tried on Windows cmd. For Windows users, download [git bash](http://www.git-scm.com/downloads) or perhaps update readme to be OS agnostic.
